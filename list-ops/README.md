## ListOps

Implement a function `count` that takes a `List` and returns the number of items in it. Please don't use any built in count or length functions, and don't use a loop to iterate lists.

You may use List's `drop`, `head`, and `tail` functions if you want. Also, pattern matching raises some interesting possibilities.

Run the tests with `sbt test`.
